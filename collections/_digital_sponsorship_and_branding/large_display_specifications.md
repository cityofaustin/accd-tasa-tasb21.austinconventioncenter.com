**Programming Policy:** It is the policy of the Austin Convention Center that these screens will not be dedicated to any single client for exclusive usage, as events for multiple clients may run simultaneously in-house. Screens will be used primarily for client content and wayfinding, to run concurrently with ACCD promotional programming such as amenities and catering services.
